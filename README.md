# CI/CD with Travis and Docker

## Agenda

* Walk through the example code
* Do we need CI/CD?
* What about Serverless?

## Example code

### Why Docker?

It's popular! Docker images give us an infrastructure agnostic
format to deploy our applications.

### Why Kubernetes?

Again, it's popular! Kubernetes gives us a cloud agnostic place
to put our Docker containers.

### We still have Heroku

We can still deploy to Heroku using Heroku Container Registry.
